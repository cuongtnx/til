# Mini Tutorial: Copy from Vim to Clipboard

Require `vim-gnome` or `vim-gtk` (lightweight like Xubuntu, Kubuntu), install with `apt-get`

Yank lines with `"+y` to copy to normal clipboard or `"*y` to copy to X11 selection (pasting with middle click)

Past inside vim using `"+p` if yanked and `"*p` if copied with `Ctrl+C`
